# Rambagh Palace- Hotel Management System

## Overview
The **Rambagh Palace Hotel Management System** project is written in Python. The project file contains a python script and a database file. This is a simple console-based system which is very easy to understand and use. Talking about the system, it contains all the information regarding the check in and check out facilities of customers and also gives the details of the customer. The customer can book room, food, etc. services. The system also provides the facility of searching the employees working in the hotel by the provided name or ID. The output gives a detailed report of the customer and the room occupied by him/her. The user can use all the available features easily without any restrictions.

The System is based on the most luxurious hotel of India- Rambagh Palace, Jaipur. Talking about the features of the Hotel Management System, a customer can create an account by providing their name, address and other personal details. Then the customer can choose the room type to book, the restaurant’s menu, laundry services menu, games menu, and calculate the grand total bill including additional charges. The users can make changes to the entered details and also delete their account from the directory.

This simple console-based Hotel Management System provides the simplest management of customer records used in the top most hotels. In short, this project mainly focuses on **CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete)**. Most hotels have well-developed software for information management but the back-end used is MS-Access. However, I have used MySQL in my project since it is a pure relational database. Updation of the status of a room is done only after 24 hours and the current status is not accurate. This issue is solved to a certain extent in my project.

### Prerequisites to run the project before installing the MySQL Connector Python-

You need root or administrator privileges to perform the installation process. Python must be installed on your machine. 

Note: – MySQL Connector Python requires python to be in the system’s PATH. Installation fails if it doesn’t find Python. 
On macOS, If Python doesn’t exist in the system’s PATH, please manually add the directory containing python.exe yourself.
